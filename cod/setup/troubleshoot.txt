General:
Write down most of your thoughts, even if you're not sure whether they're useful.
Give your variables (and files) meaningful names
Stay organized and don't leave papers all over the place!
You should know what your code is doing..

Pre-submit:
Write a few simple test cases if the sample is not enough.
Are time limits close? If so, generate max cases.
Is the memory usage fine?
Could anything overflow?
Remove debug output
Make sure to submit the right file

Wrong answer:
Print your solution! Print debug output as well.
Read the full problem statement again
Have you understood the problem correctly?
Are you sure your algorithm works?
Try writing a slow (but correct) solution
Can your algorithm handle the whole range of input?
Did you consider corner cases (e.g., n=1)?
Is your output format correct? (including whitespace)
Are you clearing all data structures between test cases?
Any uninitialized variables?
Any undefined behavior (array out of bounds)?
Any overflows or NaNs (or shifting long long by >=64 bits)?
Confusing N and M, i and j, etc.?
Confusing ++i and i++?
Return vs continue vs break?
Are you sure the STL functions you use work as you think?
Add some assertions, maybe resubmit.
Create some test cases to run your algorithm on
Go through the algorithm for a simple case
Go through this list again
Explain your algorithm to a teammate
Ask the teammate to look at your code
Go for a small walk, e.g., to the toilet.
Rewrite your solution from the start or let a teammate do it

Geometry:
Work with ints if possible
Correctly account for numbers close to (but not) zero 
 - For functions like acos, make sure the absolute value of the input is not (slightly) greater than one.
Correctly deal with vertices that are collinear, concyclic, coplanar (in 3D), etc.
Subtracting a point from every other (but not itself)?

Runtime error:
Have you tested all corner cases locally?
Any uninitialized variables?
Are you reading or writing outside the range of any vector?
Any assertions that might fail?
Any possible division by 0? (mod 0, for example)
Any possible infinite recursion?
Invalidated pointers or iterators?
Are you using too much memory?
Debug with resubmits (e.g., remapped signals, see Various).

Time limit exceeded:
Do you have any possible infinite loops?
What's your complexity? Large TL does not mean that something simple (like NlogN) isn't intended.
Are you copying a lot of unnecessary data? (Use references)
Avoid vector, map (Use arrays/unordered_map)
How big is the input and output? (Consider FastIO)
What do your teammates think about your algorithm?
Calling count() on multiset?

Memory limit exceeded:
What is the max amount of memory your algorithm should need?
Are you clearing all data structures between test cases?
If using pointers, try BumpAllocator
